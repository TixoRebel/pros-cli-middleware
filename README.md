# pros-cli-middleware
node abstraction layer for PROS CLI

## usage
run `npm i --save @purduesigbots/pros-cli-middleware` to add to your project

import functions into files:

```js
import { listTemplates } from '@purduesigbots/pros-cli-middleware'
```

### functions

all the functions listed below return a promise that resolves when the command exits successfully. this means that there are effectively two ways to call any of these functions:

```js
let r
try {
  r = await listTemplates(...)
} catch e {
  console.error(e)
}
```

```js
listTemplates(...).then(r => {...}).catch(e => console.error(e))
```

## callbacks

each function listed above takes for its first parameter a set of callbacks whose purpose is to provide an interface for GUIs to interact with data returned from the CLI. the specification for this object is as follows:

```js
{
  notify: (data: any) => void,
  log: (data: any) => void,
  prompt: (data: any, callback: (val: any) => boolean) => void,
  finalize: (data: any) => void
}
```
each callback corresponds to an event that will be propagated up from an invocation of a CLI command:

- `notify`: fired for general information updates that occur as the command runs. possible events include `notify/progress` (update a progress bar) and `notify/echo` (inform about significant operations, e.g. updating remote listings)
- `log`: fired for debugging information about the invoked command, including warnings and errors that occur
- `prompt`: fired when the command requests user input. this callback must in turn call the passed callback with the result of the user's input
- `finalize`: fired just before the command exits, sending the resultant data from the command to the UI
